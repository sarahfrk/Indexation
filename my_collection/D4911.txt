A YEAR'S EXPERIENCE WITH VIEWDATA IN DUTCH PUBLIC LIBRARIES.  IN AUG 80 60 PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE NETHERLANDS BEGAN A 12-MONTH INVESTIGATION OF THE POSSIBLE USES OF VIEWDATA IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION ARE CURRENTLY BEING STUDIED BY A WORKING PARTY SET UP BY THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE). THE CURRENT COST OF THE SYSTEM VARIES FROM *6700 TO *62,000 DEPENDING ON THE EQUIPMENT CHOSEN, PLUS THE COST OF TELEPHONE CHARGES, SUBSCRIPTION TO VIEWDATA (*62 PER MONTH) AND THE COST OF COMPUTER TIME. AT PRESENT VIEWDATA APPEARS TO HAVE LITTLE USE IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. HOWEVER, THE EXPERIMENT HAS PROVED VALUABLE IN ACQUAINTING LIBRARY STAFF AND READERS WITH THE OPERATION OF ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
